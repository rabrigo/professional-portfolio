                <p>
                    I am a creative person that enjoys making music, dancing, performing, and making videos. 
                    After working as a technician, I decided to follow through with an idea I had during the first year
                    of COVID: pursue a career path in tech. There were several motivators regarding this. At the time, I was living just 30 minutes away from Silicon Valley. 
                    Several of my friends worked in tech. I have asthma, making remote work ideal.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    My skills informed this as well. All of my work experience involved computer use. I studied J# in high school through AP Computer Science
                    and dabbled in 2d game engines. At my most recent job, I was already practicing behaviors crucial to 
                    working in tech. I was practicing analytical thinking, troubleshooting hardware and software, collaborating across different teams, and adopting a solution driven mindset.
