                <p>
                    I am a creative person that enjoys making music, dancing, performing, and making videos. 
                    After working as a technician, I decided to follow through with an idea I had during the first year
                    of COVID: pursue a career path in tech. There were several elements informing this endeavor. At the time, I was living 30 minutes away from Silicon Valley. 
                    Several of my friends worked in tech. I have asthma which makes remote work ideal.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    My skills informed this as well. All of my work experience involved computer use. I was exposed to coding in high school when I took AP Computer Science
                    and when I was dabbling in game engines. At my most recent job, I was already practicing behaviors fundamental to 
                    working in tech: practicing analytical thinking, troubleshooting solutions, collaborating across different teams, and adopting a solution driven mindset.
